## When I start Programming?

This is a long story... Back into 2020 when the largest worldwide pandemic - COVID-19 broke out. On 16th of March, the government of Malaysia announced for a full lockdown (known as Movement Control Order) to control the spread of the coronavirus.

This is when my programming journey begins. When the lockdown time keeps extending, from 14 days to 90 days, I literally got mad as everyday I was just playing Minecraft besides studying.

One day, when I was watching some of the random videos from YouTube, I discovered my first programming language - Python (honestly mostly everyone starts from here). I quickly fell in love on the world of programming. Seriously, school lessons really boring and the most reliable way to relieve my boreness is to grind projects.

Soon in July, I got introduced about Github, where it is a very perfect place for me to store my code (instead of my 16gb pendrive). Since the born of Github on my brain, I started my first huge project - a music player. In the process of making the project, I learnt more than those YouTube courses. Also, making projects really made me fun - as I'm doing a thing that no one could do it for themselves.

At that year, instead of a prison year, it's the most for me. I never wasted anything along the lockdown period, and thanks for the lockdown, I have my life target.

### And then?

In the end if the year, the pandemic finally falls to a safe level. That means that I have to go back to school, sitting on the class and learning on those useless stuff (honestly school just wasting my precious time). Start from that time, I'm too tired for programming, and I stopped for a long time.

### 2021 - Years for public exam

This year, I have some of my free time for coding. So in this year, instead of doing projects, I decided to explore more on a variety types of programming jobs. Since I have to sit for my public exam, I have to be more concentrate on study, and I got forced to shrink my coding time.

### 2022 - The year that defined my target

As explore continues, I found my final target - Front-end developer. And start from this year, I will be more concentrate on front end stuff. At the same time, I started my first (full) project - ManaMetal (check for ManaWeb, ManaDocs on my repo). 

At the same time, I very regret that I joined Science stream. Seriously science is a nightmare for me, it totally juiced all my programming time.
