```
Words for you:
Either you saw this or not, just to tell you that good luck and hope you will mentally grow up one day.
Thanks for being one of my longest friend but I think this is the end.
Farewell. 好聚好散。

# My coding story

Start from 2020, I involved myself in the world of programming to kill my time especially on lockdown period. After several months of programming, I found myself interesting in front-end developing.

In 2022, I was luckily to be introduced to the competitive programming. Because of this, I got a larger programming community and have a precious chance to represent school.
